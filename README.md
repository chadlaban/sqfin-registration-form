# SQ SEY LTD - Registration Form - Onboarding Technical Test

This project is a registration form that sends a POST request to an API endpoint. It's built using Vue.js (Nuxt.js), styled with SASS, and form validation from ZOD.

## Notes:

```bash
- Design implementation is partial; styles were based on the landing page due to lack of access to the Figma file.
- API integration was intentionally omitted, as the base URL appeared to be missing from the documentation. For reference on my experience with implementing CRUD operations, please see my other GitHub repository using Vue: https://github.com/chadlaban/just-real-estate
- These concerns were communicated to the recruiter prior to submission.
- The project is submitted on its current state, reflecting the above constraints.
